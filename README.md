Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Emmanuel, a data analyst from Ghana who loves to work on projects in food and agriculture, climate change,community and economic development.
I enjoy wowrking with python(pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) and also exploring data with SQL.
I am currently reading and learning on carbon footprint reduction in agriculture value chain from production to consumers to waste. 
My goal is to use my knowledge, skills, energy and data to solve life's challenging food problems in rural Africa. 
I love to read, travel and experience new cultures and people. You can reach me on emmadokyi@gmail.com
